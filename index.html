                    <p class="text-light"> Virtual reality is a big buzzword these days. Tech companies in the 21st century are pouring resources into producing the next generation of virtual reality headsets. Some of these products are the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and the Hololens to name a few. Augmented reality is also on the rise, with the recent Pokemon Go viral hit being a classic example of mass consumer interest in augmented reality. Virtual reality doesn't only have a gaming application, but can also be used by surgeon's to practice and become better as well as real estate agents to showcase properties abroad; the possibilities are endless. VR and AR is interesting too because it is an amalgamation of a lot of topics we’ve learned in our Digital Information Age class, from circuits to silicon chip conductors to basic signal processing. Below we will give a brief overview of VR/AR throughout history.  </p>

                	<p class="lead text-muted">In 1838, Charles Wheatstone, an English scientist, invented the stereoscope. He did research on how the brain perceives depth, specifically how 2-D images are processed by the eye. He found that the brain could interpret 2-D images as a single 3D image with the proper geometry, providing depth to images and making them more immersive. These were the first steps in crafting a virtual reality, albeit a very rudimentary one at that. These design ideas can be found in modern day technologies, such as the Google Cardboard, which is a cheap VR display for mobile phones.</p>

                	<p class="lead text-light">In 1929, Edward Link, an aviation pioneer, created the“Link trainer, ” one of the first flight simulators. While we remember playing flight simulation software as kids, this simulator did not use a mouse and monitor; rather, it was entirely electromechanical. It had motors connected to rudders that allowed the user to steer the plane, and this motor also created artificial turbulence and disturbances.  Next, in 1935, the American science fiction write Stanley Weinbaum brought virtual reality to the limelight with his short story "Pygmalion’s Spectacles", where the main character meets a professor who created a pair of goggles that allows the wearer to enter a fictional holographic world.  Who would have thought that that less than a century later this science fiction would turn into a reality.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-muted">In the 1990’s, gaming companies like Nintendo and Sega spurred the interest in virtual reality by researching and developing VR headsets to play arcade games in. Specifically, in 1993 Sega introduced the Sega VR headset, which was a pair of prototype glasses that had the basic components of modern headsets such as head tracking, LCD screens, and stereo sound. Unsurprisingly, due to technical difficulties, a full product was never rolled out and the Sega VR headset remained just a prototype. Next, in 1995, Nintendo created the Nintendo Virtual Boy, a 3D gaming console marketed as the first portable console to display 3D graphics. Nintendo faced a similar fate as Sega though, and this product was a commercial failure as the games only 2 colors were red and black, there was poor software support, and was difficult to use. Virtual reality found it’s way into the spotlight again when the Matrix came out, a movie that is engrained in pop culture and one of our personal favorites.  As well all know, the film featured characters living in a fully simulated environment, with most people unaware that they were not living in reality. This movie and it’s series had a big cultural influence and brought the questions associated with the implications of VR and AR to the limelight.  </p>

                    <p class="lead text-light">We have seen an explosion in virtual reality advancements during our generation, where technology has gotten exponentially faster as predicted by Moore’s law. Computer has become especially small and powerful with the immense scale of production driving prices down. Furthermore, the rise of smartphones with 3D graphic capabilities has spurred the access of VR to the masses and has allowed people to use lightweight and cheaper headsets like the Google cardboard as mentioned previously. Samsung is developing a similar product, the Galaxy Gear, which has been mass produced and includes features like gesture control as well. It has been fascinating growing up in a time where virtual reality, once only a thing of TV and movie screens, is now a reality in the true sense of the word. </p>

			<h2 class="section-header"> <br> Future of Virtual Reality</h2>
			<p class="lead text-muted">While there has been a lot of innovation in virtual reality recently, there is a lot of room for growth. While the potential is there, devices still need to be tethered to a computer due to the high computing power needed to run the 3D graphic capabilities, and devices can still shrink and become more compact. On the software side of things, a lot of researchers are working on projects such as stabilization, as a lot of users report nausea when using VR headsets for extended periods of time. Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus Rift for $2 billion in 2014 shows that investors are pouring money into developing the next generation of devices, and we are excited to see where VR and AR technology goes in the future.</p>
