# History of of Virtual Reality
##Final Project for Digital Information Age
## Tomer Solomon, December 2016 

With the rise of virtual reality in the 21st century, we thought it would be interesting to take a look and see the technologies of the past that have allowed for products like Oculus, HTC Vive, and HoloLens to become a reality (pun intended!).  As such, we whipped up a website to give people an overview of VR/AR related innovations from the 1800â€™s to the present. Enjoy!

Take a look at the website: http://www.columbia.edu/~ts2838/virtualreality/
